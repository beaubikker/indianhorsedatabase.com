''What can correct illusions but the truth? And what are errors but
illusions that remain unrecognized for what they are? Where truth has
entered errors disappear. They merely vanish, leaving not a trace by
which to be remembered. They are gone because, without belief, they
have no life. And so they disappear to nothingness, returning whence
they came. From dust to dust they come and go, for only truth
remains.''
